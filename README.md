# CloudSeeder

CloudSeeder is a modular platform designed to enable seamless application development and deployment across local, containerized, and cloud environments. It provides libraries and a seed application to help you build complex systems from a simple, extensible starting point.

## Key Features

- **Local-First Development**: Develop entirely on local resources using bare-metal implementations, ensuring quick and efficient development cycles.
- **Containerized Transition**: Once the local system is ready, easily transition to containerized builds for testing and production deployment.
- **Cloud-Ready**: Deploy with minimal configuration changes to cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP.
- **Monorepo Structure**: Organized as a monorepo for easy collaboration and management of core libraries and applications.
- **Abstracted Messaging and File Access**: Use local or cloud-based messaging systems and file storage with consistent APIs.
- **Authentication Support**: Built-in authentication mechanisms for secure operations, including JWT and OAuth2.

## Monorepo Structure

The CloudSeeder repository is structured as follows:

source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Frontend:

```bash
cd ../frontend
yarn install
Running the Seed Application
```
## Start the Backend:
